1.1.0 (2026-01-10)

 * Added selection functionality, and adjusted key bindings:
    - C-t or Insert toggle whether the current item is selected;
    - + and - adjust the selection using shell globs;
    - t and T insert the selection into the external command line
      in relative or absolute form, respectively;
    - Enter is like t but enters directories;
    - C-g or Escape clear the selection, similarly to the editor.

 * Added an sdn-view script that can process Midnight Commander mc.ext.ini files
   and apply matching filters; this script has been made the default F3 binding,
   while the original direct pager invocation has been moved to F13 (which also
   reflects Midnight Commander)

 * Added an sdn-open script which does the same kind of processing as above
   on top of xdg-open.  This is what is now executed by M-Enter.

 * Added support for Cygwin, in particular the MSYS2 flavour.


1.0.0 (2024-12-21)
